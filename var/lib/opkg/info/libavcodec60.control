Description: A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode,
 transcode,                mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much
 anything that humans and machines                have created. It
 supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the cutting edge.
