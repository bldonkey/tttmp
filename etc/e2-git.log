[HarddiskSetup] Change "Initialize" to "Format" A storage device is initialised automatically when you record, go to flash online etc without any user interevention. The context of the menu/ question is that it is asking if we want to format the device, not if we want to initialise it. (initail setup for use). Most E2 users are from a Windows background and "Format" in this context reflects the function in a more user friendly term.

[Debug] Provide ability to create core dump
[DVD] Fix infobar show / hide and introduce angle label text This fix tries to disable the InfoBar showing in DVD menues which is annoying because it allows actions in the menu only if the InfoBar is hidden. Also a new text is added to show the camera perspective of DVDs that support it. MetrixHD does not have an Icon for it. So thus the textual description. Furthermore there is a fix to a print statement for logging / debugging purpose.
